<h1 align=center><HSH - Holberton shell>

This project is an imitation of a linux shell such as bash, however it is not totally developed, this means that it doesnot do everything that the shell itself does. We developed it since 08-12-2021 till 08-26-2021.It´s inspired in other shells like bash.Our shell is also capable of executing  commands like the ls command with several options such as -a.
This project has been done in c through the shell.
